1. Clone this project, then modify these files to suit your project needs: 

index.html
gulpfile.js
.gitignore
scss/styles.scss
.gitignore 

NOTE: gulp will automatically create the css/styles.css for you when you run it.

2. In the bash terminal, install all the dependencies by entering this in the command line:
` npm install `

3. To run gulp and have gulp watch the changes you make:
` gulp watch `
